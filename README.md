We offer lessons in skateboarding that will take you from 0 to 100 in 30 min. We have plenty of equipment ( boards and helmets ) or bring your own. We teach at skateparks and come the park closest to you. We focus on techniques and safety also, learning how to stop, how and when to bail, and how to fall so you donâ€™t get hurt. We generally have students riding on the ramps by the end of the first 30 min lesson. Students benefit from just one lesson but by coming back for a few lessons also seems to get the groundwork for learning on your own. I have students take 4 lessons then Skate on their own for a bit then they come back for further guidance in a few weeks. 
We offer lesson packages to help keep things affordable- 

1 lesson 30 min one on one - $30
1 lesson 1 hr one on one - $50
1 group lesson 30 min - $25
2 30 min one on one lessons $55
3 30 min one on one lessons $75
5 30 min one on one lessons $100


Thanks and have fun! Go Skate!
